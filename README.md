# Vardeltus Manufacturing Software
A CAD/CAM Software that focuses on creating an efficient workflow.

# Purpose:
Vardeltus Manufacturing Software (VMS) exists to provide an alternative to [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) and the non-FOSS CAD/CAM programs.

The industry standards of today follow practices which are less than ideal such as requiring the user to subscribe to a service and pay a reoccurring cost, only functioning on MS Windows, as well as being proprietary software. While these practices are understandable, VMS seeks to provide an alternative to them.

While [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) is FOSS and does fit VMS's ideal practices, its interface and user experience is less than desirable. The [Ondsel ES](https://ondsel.com/) people are attempting to fix that and it seems that they are making progress. However, it is not to the standards which VMS wishes to achieve currently and it is unclear if they will get there in a timely manner.

# To-do:
- Make an actual CAD software (currently it is just a program which makes lines via user mouse inputs)
- Redo this README.md so that it feels less like a manifesto and is less "*righteous*" as well as adding useful information here.

# Software Used:
VMS is written in [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/)

VMS was built off of Nikolas Wipper's port of [Raylib 5](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) - [Raylib Zig](https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig)
